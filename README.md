# HashMap - Portfolio Assignment

Data Structure & Algorithms
Implemented a codebase that handled collisions through open addressing and separate chaining while maintaining an efficient runtime complexity of O(1). There are two files -- one that implements a HashMap using separate chaining with linked lists, and the other implements HashMap with quadratic probing.

## Separate Chaining
## Quadratic Probing

## Instructions
- To run the program, download the files and open the files using the IDE of preference.
- Run the code through your IDE.
